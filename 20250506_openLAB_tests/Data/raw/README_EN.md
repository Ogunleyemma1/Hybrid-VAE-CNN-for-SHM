All position references relate to support axis 10 (south-west), x = 0.

The load was introduced into precast element (PE) 2.1 using two hydraulic jacks positioned centrally in the web (x = 24.3 m, corresponding to the region of maximum bending moment due to dead load).

## Additional notes

- For the first five loading steps (up to u_max = 40 mm), the data were zeroed (tared) before the start of measurement.
- Subsequently, the target displacement (starting from zero) was applied.  
- For loading steps 6 and 7, no taring was performed.  
- The tare values from the initial loading steps are included in the measurement files (lines 28 and 29) and enable the calculation of absolute displacements.


## Python script

The included script is structured as follows:

1. Data import
2. Post-processing:
    During the load plateaus (constant displacement, u = 5�60 mm), additional measurements were carried out on the bridge. In some cases, the laser beam path was obstructed (e.g., in the load application area), resulting in implausible readings. These outliers were filtered as follows:
    - A measurement point was removed if
        1. the length change to the previous measurement exceeded 1 mm, and
        2. the total displacement exceeded 65 mm.
    - Additionally, a moving average filter with a window size of 5 was applied.
