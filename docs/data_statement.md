# Data statement

## Overview

This repository contains code for a hybrid structural health monitoring (SHM) workflow comprising:

1. **Synthetic simulations** (1DOF and 4DOF structural systems) generated by scripts in `experiments/1dof/` and `experiments/4dof/`.
2. **Open-access field monitoring data** from the openLAB Research Bridge (TU Dresden), processed by scripts in `experiments/openlab/`.

The repository is organized such that **raw datasets are not committed** (to keep the repository lightweight and to respect third-party distribution policies). Processed artifacts required to reproduce figures and metrics are generated locally using the provided scripts.

## External dataset: openLAB Research Bridge monitoring data

Monitoring Data of the openLAB Research Bridge – Load Test on PE 2.1:

- **Authors**: Max Herbers, Bertram Richter, Maria Walker, Steffen Marx (TU Dresden)
- **Repository**: Open Access Repository and Archive (OPARA), TU Dresden
- **DOI**: 10.25532/OPARA-852
- **License**: CC BY-SA 4.0

The original dataset (measurement `.txt` files) must be obtained from the official archive and placed locally under:

- `experiments/openlab/datasets/raw/`

The repository does not redistribute these files.

### Test runs used

The openLAB load tests were carried out on **May 06, 2025** (times in UTC+00:00). The following measurement files are referenced in the accompanying documentation and scripts:

1. `MD_2025_05_06_09_08_25.txt`
2. `MD_2025_05_06_10_43_20.txt`
3. `MD_2025_05_06_12_05_10.txt`
4. `MD_2025_05_06_13_43_17.txt`
5. `MD_2025_05_06_16_07_15.txt`
6. `MD_2025_05_06_17_39_40.txt`
7. `MD_2025_05_06_18_30_51.txt`

### Channel description (abridged)

The dataset includes multiple channels, including force (hydraulic jacks), displacement (laser distance sensors), strain, and temperature. Channel mapping and handling are documented in `experiments/openlab/` and the scripts that import and process the raw files.

## Synthetic data generated in this repository

### 1DOF experiment (VAE interpretability)

The 1DOF experiment generates displacement time series for seen families (e.g., `normal`, `drifted`, `noisy`) and unseen variants (e.g., amplitude or frequency shifts). These datasets are generated locally and written into:

- `experiments/1dof/datasets/raw/`
- `experiments/1dof/datasets/processed/`

### 4DOF experiment (model validation)

The 4DOF experiment generates multi-channel structural responses for normal operation and structural fault cases (terminology: **normal** and **structural fault**). Datasets are generated locally and written into:

- `experiments/4dof/datasets/`

## Data access and deletion

To remove all local datasets and outputs created by running the scripts, delete:

- `experiments/*/datasets/`
- `experiments/*/outputs/`

No data are uploaded by the code.
